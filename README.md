# About Me #
## Hello my name is Tierany Peterson. ## 
### When i graduated from Central High School i had no idea what i wanted to be or do with my life, so i went to [Southwest Community College] (https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tTP1TcwNirOMjJg9FItzi8tyShPLS5RKEnNy0stLk5NVUjOz80tzcssqQSycnJS01MBqqsSAw&q=southwest+tennessee+community+college&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS957US957&oq=southwest+te&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46j46i175i199j0j0i457j46i175i199j0l2j46i175i199j0i271.7389j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to get a general education associates degree, and figure out what i wanted to be for the rest of my life. Throughout my journey in community college i found my passion through psychology,and sociology classes. When i got my associates it was right when covid had happened, and i decided i would like to pursue social work and take a ``break`` from college. ###
** But then.. **
A friend of mine told me about his career as a software developer, which intrigued me.
I was nervous at first but i later signed myself up for coding classes at Code Crew.
***And the rest was history***
