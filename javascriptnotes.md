# JavaScriptNotes

**What is JavaScript?**
- Javascript is  a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages.

**JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.**

**There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:**

-Using var

-Using let

-Using const

Var-(Variables)-Variables are containers for storing data (values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
var x = 5;

var y = 6;

var z = x + y
~x stores the value 5~
~ystores the value 6~
~z stores the value 11~


**Another Good Example**

In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:

var price1 = 5;

var price2 = 6;

var total = price1 + price2;

In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables (like price1) to hold values.

In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables in expressions (total = price1 + price2).

From the example above, you can calculate the total to be 11.

**JavaScript Identifiers**

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

-The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

-Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

-Names must begin with a letter

-Names can also begin with $ and _ 

-Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

-Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

**The Assignment Operator**

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

x = x + 5
In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)

The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.


**Declaring Java Variable**

Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:

var carName;

**Creating Many Java Variables**

You can declare many variables in one statement.

Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma:

var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
