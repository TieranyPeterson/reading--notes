Growth Mindset- believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort

fixed mindset- belives thatintelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone
without the need for further development or effort.

No Pain No Gain- is an example of a growth mindset.

With These 4 changes you can change a fixed mindset into a growth mindset.

1.No pain No gain- To get the result you want you have to work for it.

2.Persist with obstacles- I took this as dont give up, remember why you want to succeed in this field and believe in yourself that you can do it.

3.Learn from Criticism- I took this as dont be angry at criticism be able to take in new ideas, and critiques that can better you overall.

4.Be inspired by others success- I took this as dont be jelous or intimidated by your peers admire the hard work that they put in to get to where they are and thats a growth mindset
