**What is a Wireframe?**
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create theirs.
**How to Make a WireFrame in six steps**
 -Do your research
 -Prepare your research for reference
 -Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
 -Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
 -Add some detail and get testing
 -Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
 **Three key princes to making a good wireframe**
 -Clarity  Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.
 -Confidence  If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes.
 Simplicity- Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals.
 **Mozilla HTML Basics**
 [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
 In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
 **Semantics in Java**
 In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent.
 **Semantics in CSS**
 n HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
 Ex of Semantics:
 -<article>
 -<aside>
 -<details>
 -<figcaption>
 -<figure>
 -<footer>
 -<header>
 -<main>
 -<mark>
 -<nav>
 -<section>
 -<summary>
 -<time>
